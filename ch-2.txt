flutter packages get: to make sure flutter picks up pubspec.yaml file

.idea: holds some configurations for android studio
build: holds the output of the application
.metadata: flutter tool will save some information here whih it will needs to build our application correctly
same for .packages: it will manage some internal dependencies, some packages this project needs
flutter_complete_guide.iml: manage some internal dependencies and some settings for this project
pubspec.yaml: will allow you to manage the dependencies of your project, you can configure which other 3rd party packages your project might be using, you can configure other things like fonts and images you want to use in your application
pubspec.lock: will holds more details about all the dependencies you have

class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  Person({ required this.name, this.age = 30});
}

class Person {
  String name = '';
  int age = 30;
//   Person({ required this.name, this.age = 30});
  Person(String name,int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

MaterialApp uses a named argument, Text uses a positional argument
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

because of type inference we can remove Generic type from column children as soon as we start adding widgets
